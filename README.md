# ImmersiveMediaRobotics

In the context of the interdisciplinary project "Immersive Media for Robotics" conception and implementation of a virtual reality app, which is to create added value in the field of robotics through a tangible transfer of knowledge. Thereby the users should be sensitized for the image processing of sensors (e.g. proximity switch, radar, LiDar, depth camera etc.), as well as the corresponding facts and develop an understanding for limitations and technology. By means of gameification, these limitations can be illustrated to the different target groups in a playful way.
